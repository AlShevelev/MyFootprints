# MyFootprints 
When traveling, people tend to make a lot of beautiful and interesting photos. And then painfully trying to remember: "Where did I do such a beautiful picture?"
Now this is not a problem - this app allows you to store not only your photos, but also the place where they were made. And then, in the evening, at the hotel, you can easily share your photos with friends and family, just put them in a social network, sending an e-mail or through a messenger.
